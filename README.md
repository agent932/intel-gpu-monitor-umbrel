# Agent932 Umbrel App Store ☂️

This repository contains my custom Umbrel App Store. Unlike the official store, this one is entirely community-driven and independently maintained. It offers apps created and shared by the community, but it is important to note that this store is not affiliated with or supported by the official Umbrel team. All updates, management, and content in this app store are handled independently.

🔀 I am open to app suggestions and will do my best to implement them.
