description: >-
  Intel GPU Monitor provides real-time monitoring of Intel integrated GPUs for Umbrel.
  Perfect for seeing which apps are using hardware acceleration and monitoring GPU
  performance on Intel-based home servers.


  Track GPU usage, frequency, power consumption, and see exactly which apps
  (like Plex or Jellyfin) are using your GPU for hardware transcoding.


  Features:
  - Real-time GPU metrics (usage, frequency, power)
  - Per-engine breakdown (Video decode/encode, Render/3D, Blitter)
  - Process detection - see which apps are using GPU
  - Automatic app recognition (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, etc.)
  - Beautiful web dashboard with live updates
  - Umbrel homepage widget support


  Requirements:
  - Intel CPU with integrated graphics (6th gen or newer recommended)
  - Works great with Intel NUC, N100/N95 mini PCs, and other Intel-based hardware
